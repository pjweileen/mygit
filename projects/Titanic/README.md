# 🛳 Titanic Data Analysis - Kaggle Project

This repository contains data exploration and analysis performed on the **Titanic Dataset** from Kaggle.  
The goal is to understand patterns behind survival and explore variables such as gender, class, age, and family status.


## 📘 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning fromDisaster
- **Files Used:**
  - `train.csv` — used for EDA and modeling



## 🔍 EDA Summary

### ✔ Basic Exploration
- Checked data types, missing values (`Age`, `Cabin`, `Embarked` had the most missing)
- Generated descriptive statistics
- Reviewed unique values of categorical variables

### ✔ Key Insights
- **Females had significantly higher survival rates** than males  
- **1st class passengers survived more** compared to others  
- Younger passengers (children) generally survived more  
- Fare and passenger class showed strong correlation with survival

### ✔ Visualizations
- Survival rate by gender (bar chart)
- Survival rate by Pclass (bar chart)
- Age distribution (histogram)
- Correlation heatmap
